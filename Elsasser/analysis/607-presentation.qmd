## Overview

Music is a mystery. We can easily appreciate it without understanding it, but I believe that understanding it can deepen our appreciation. I have always wanted to view music through the lens of a computer. This project is my first data science step in that direction.

## The Data

Source: Aligned Scores and Performances ([ASAP](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset)) dataset.

The [Music](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset):

- The hierarchy is generally: `<composer>/<collection>/<content>`. There are exceptions. The foolproof way to navigate the hiearchy is through what I call the "manifest", but is actually called [metadata.csv](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/metadata.csv).

The [Wrangler](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/tree/main/Elsasser/assembler):

- Parses MIDI files into CSVs: one CSV file for every score, and one CSV file for every performance.
- Updates [metadata.csv](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/metadata.csv) with CSV paths, performer names, and composer birth and death years.
- Calculates some simple metrics such as [density](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Elsasser/assembler/src/metrics.ts#L15) and [interval](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Elsasser/assembler/src/metrics.ts#L40).

[Data Analysis](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/tree/main/Elsasser/analysis):

- A wrangler, [wrangle.R](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/tree/main/Elsasser/analysis/wrangle.R), that loads and processes data.
- Includes [EDA](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Elsasser/analysis/explore.qmd). More E than DA.
- This presentation and some of his friends lives there.

## Scores vs. Performances

Performances and scores are very closely related, but they are not the same. The score is the composition as written by the composer. The performance is the composition as played by the performer. Classical music is a very structured genre, but the performance of it is very expressive. It's very difficult to reproduce it in it's entirety with metadata such as dynamics. Where the tempo, key-signature and time-signature are meaningful in the score, they are meaningless in the performances in this repository. Simply, the score is the blueprint, the performance is the building.

## Wrangling
The [wrangler](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Elsasser/assembler/) is a command line application written in Typescript. It supports three [commands](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Elsasser/assembler/src/index.ts):

:::{.incremental}
- MIDI file -> CSV file: `assembler file <path-MIDI> <path-CSV>`
- CSV manifest -> CSV files: `assembler list <path-CSV>`
- Dump a MIDI file: `assembler dump <path-MIDI>`
:::

### Why Typescript?

:::{.incremental}
* Because there exists a MIDI parser, ([midi-file-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/midi-file-io)) that I like to work with. 
* `midi-file-parser` doesn't presume anything and it returns parsed data in a strongly typed [MidiIoSong](https://github.com/celsasser/midi-file-io/blob/HEAD/src/types.ts#L109) data structure.
* I came to appreciate the TypeScript compiler. It's a great tool for catching errors.

## Wide or Long?

I oscillated back and forth with this question:

- [Narrow](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Elsasser/assembler/src/file.ts#L244): it's not tidy but it's lean.
- [Wide](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Elsasser/assembler/src/file.ts#L306): it's tidy but it's bloated.

Ultimately, I committed to wide for two reasons:

1. It's easier to process in R.
2. Most of the compositions are short. File size wasn't a problem.

An example of the wide format is [Bach's Fugue, BWV 846](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Bach/Fugue/bwv_846/midi_score.csv).

  }, ncol = 3)
```

## EDA: Velocity by Performer

```{r}
tbl_fugue_bwv_848 |> ggplot(mapping = aes(
    x = time_offset, 
    y = velocity, 
    color = performer
    )
  ) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    title = str_c(
      tbl_fugue_bwv_848$title,
      ", ",
      tbl_fugue_bwv_848$key_signature,
      ", ",
      tbl_fugue_bwv_848$composer
    ),
    x = "Time",
    y = "Velocity"
  )
```

## EDA: Velocity Distribution by Performer

```{r}
tbl_fugue_bwv_848 |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = velocity, color = performer)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(
    title = str_c(
      tbl_fugue_bwv_848$title,
      ", ",
      tbl_fugue_bwv_848$key_signature,
      ", ",
      tbl_fugue_bwv_848$composer
    ),
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~performer)
```

## EDA: Velocity by Year

  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "Year Written",
    y = "Note Velocity"
  )
```

## EDA: Density Calculation

Measures how dense a composition is over small units of time. The approach I took to [calculating](https://github.com/celsasser/asap-dataset/blob/main/Elsasser/assembler/src/metrics.ts#L15) it was to use a sliding window. It does a couple of special little things like stepping backwards, but essentially it is as simple as follows:

$$
f(song, window) \rightarrow \sum_{n=0}^{song.width}\frac{window(song)}{\sqrt{window.width}}
$$
where:

- `song` - the song for which to calculate the density
- `song.width` - is the width of the song in MIDI ticks
- `window` - the window that slides over the song, note by note
- `window.width` - is the width of the window to look ahead in MIDI ticks
- `window(song)` - the number of notes in the window


## EDA: Music Score Density

```{r}
tbl_scores_music |>
  filter(composer == "Mozart") |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = time_offset, y = density)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Mozart",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~title, scale = "free", ncol = 2)
```

## Conclusion

It feels as if I'm just scratching the surface. Nonetheless, even with the small amount of analysis I've performed, revelations were made that lead me to believe that there is more insight to be to be found in studying rectangularized music. 

## Oh the Places You'll Go

What is next? We shall see. Some ideas that interest me are:

- Translate compositions into note graphs.
- Expand upon and improve the density calculation.
- Create similarity equations/algorithms that compare two compositions.
- It would be interesting to include an audible element in the analysis.
- I'm hoping future semesters will offer new opportunities to further explore this dataset.

## Naughty or Nice

The Well-Tempered Clavier I No. 3 in C-sharp major

It is the most impossible key in the whole of the Wohltemperirte Clavier: C-sharp major. No fewer than seven sharps adorn the beginning of each staff. Furthermore, it is an unnecessarily complicated key, as instead of seven sharps you could use five flats to write exactly the same pitch – as D-flat major. In 1728, the music theorist Johann David Heinichen therefore classified C-sharp major as one of the ‘superfluous keys’. Here, Bach is deliberately toying with the mind of the keyboard player, as the instinctive correspondence between the black noteheads on the paper and the fingers on the keys no longer works.
